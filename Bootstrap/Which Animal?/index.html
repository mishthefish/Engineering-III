          <p>Harvey is a lovable ball of furious energy.
            He loves going outside and exploring the grass,
            catching grasshoppers and chasing squirrels.
            Keep a close eye on this one; he also likes to
            climb!

            Jasper is a 4 year old male. He is a cutie pie with blonde
            and white short hair. He is ready for a new forever home,
            shots are up to date and already neutered. He is a happy,
            healthy, playful little cat who is friendly, outgoing and
            seems to like everybody he meets. Sadly his owner had to
            relinquish him as she couldn't take care of him
            anymore. She wanted him to have a better life than she
            could give him. So Jasper will make a new family, person
            or persons very lucky to adopt him. He has loads of
            personality and wonderful qualities that make him very
            special.

          <p>
            Chloe is a tad over a year old and one of the sweetest
	    adults we have fostered.  This female cat is beautiful
	    inside and out. Her medium long silky fur and striking
	    green eyes get you at first blink. Then you pet her and
	    she "lays it all out" for you by rolling over and
	    purring. She grooms her long fur meticulously like a diva
	    and she waits for your appreciation of her. She is just a
	    sweet, sweet cat looking for a loving adopter. Chloe is a
	    tad over a year old and one of the sweetest cats we have
	    fostered. Chloe would make a good family pet in a
	    household with loving people, including children. Dogs are
	    not her favorite but another nice cat could be dandy.
