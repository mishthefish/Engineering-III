    		        Whales are some of the largest living animals. They
    		        live in the ocean, having fully adapted to living
    		        in the water.  They are mammals!

    		        Sharks are known for being apex predators, but some
    		        sharks only eat small fish.  Sharks teeth never stop
    		        growing, with old ones constantly falling out and 
    		        being replaced by new teeth.

    		        Dolphins are highly intelligent animals, demonstrated by their
    		        curiosity and complex social structure.  Although they
    		        live in the ocean, they breathe air. Lucky for them, they
    		        can hold their breath for up to 15 minutes.

    		        Octopi are also very intelligent animals.  There are several
    		        cases of octopi escaping from aquariums.  They are able
    		        to change the color and even the texture of their skin at will!
