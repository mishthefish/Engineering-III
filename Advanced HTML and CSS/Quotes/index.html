        <p>            
            I’m a PhD student in economics at MIT. I studied economics in
            undergrad and after spending a  year as a consultant, came to MIT in
            2013. I focus on development -- why are poor countries  poor? -- and
            political economy -- why do political leaders make the decisions
            that they do? Most of my work involves traveling to different
            countries to collect data, most recently  Uganda and the Democratic
            Republic of the Congo, but I also work with existing data sets that
            have been collected by other researchers or organizations like the
            World Bank.

            One secret of economics, like any data-based science, is that there
            is a lot of coding that goes  into producing our final analyses. I
            mostly work in Stata, a data analysis program, but I also do some
            work in Python. Most of the coding I do is to combine and clean data
            sets. A simple  example would be that I do two different surveys
            with the same set of people and then I want to  have all of the
            answers that one person gave in a single file for analysis. A more
            complicated  example might involve combining data from different
            agencies, which use different identifiers:  one of the agencies
            writes “Tennessee” and another writes “TN”. Maybe a third agency
            even has  data at the level of cities or counties. Combining this
            data means writing code that not only  merges the files, but also
            gives them all a common set of IDs so that all of the data can work
            together -- writing good code can be the difference between having
            all your data in one place  versus scattered across many files.

            public works program possible.

            The other way I use coding is to collect data. Even working on
            development topics, there is a surprising amount of data that’s
            online. More and more countries are posting data to webpages  as
            part of transparency efforts. I use Python to make simple web-
            scrapers to download this data  in batches. Knowing how to code can
            save tens or hundreds of hours and makes projects like  analyzing
            the complete history of a huge Indian public works program possible.

	         By hand, that would have taken days if not weeks -- with Python I
            did it overnight. As data sets grow  larger and larger, knowing how
            to code effectively is only getting more important in economics.

            Knowing programming languages like Python can also save you tons of
            time in surprising ways: in February, I needed to rapidly format
            thousands of assignment sheets for my survey teams to take with them
            into the  field. By hand, that would have taken days if not weeks --
            with Python I did it overnight. As data sets grow  larger and
            larger, knowing how to code effectively is only getting more
            important in economics. Today’s grad students are much better
            equipped if they have programming experience in high school and
            college,  since it makes learning new techniques easier -- and they
            can often leverage their existing knowledge. Plus, it’s always
            pretty cool to be able to go for a walk outside and tell people “I’m
            working right now: my code  is running.” Always good to have the
            computer working for you!
