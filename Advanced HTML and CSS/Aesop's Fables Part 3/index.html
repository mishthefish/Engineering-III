<!-- Copy your code from Aesop's Fables Part 2.

Add a CSS animation (in style.css) called "open-book" that changes
any book's dimensions from a height of 200 px and a width of 100px
to a height of 400px and a width of 300px.

Then add the animation to the CSS rule so that the animation
starts when you hover over a book.

You don't need to modify your HTML file!
